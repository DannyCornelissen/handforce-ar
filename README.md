## Background <a name="background"></a>
Stroke victims often have difficulty with the simplest of tasks–drinking coffee, for instance. Your task is to design, build, and test a system that allows a stroke victim to regain the use of their hand. Normally, this requires intensive physiotherapy that is personally supervised by a trained professional. In place of this, we believe an augmented reality system that combines real physical objects with virtual interactivity can allow the stroke patient to train at home. For example: a stroke patient wants to be able to independently drink a cup of coffee, but no longer has sufficient control over the hands and fingers to reliably lift and hold stable a cup. The physical training is relatively simple: start with a very light (but very strong) cup-like object so that the patient can practice gripping and lifting the cup. Move on to heavier cups until the patient can lift a coffee cup reliably to their lips without spilling hot coffee on themselves.
